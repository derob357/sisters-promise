# Backend logic provided by genezio

`genezio` is a platform that allows developers to write, deploy, and use serverless APIs with ease. With `genezio`, developers can write their backend logic in classes and design their frontend using their preferred programming language.

Once the backend classes are written, `genezio` deploys them onto a serverless infrastructure. The platform generates an SDK that developers can use to remotely call the methods of their class in a very natural way, making it easy to call backend logic from the client.

The platform comes with a handful of examples to start from, and developers can integrate it into their CI/CD pipeline with a dedicated GitHub action.
